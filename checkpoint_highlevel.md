### What is Checkpoint
Checkpoint is a library for indexing data from StarkNet events and making it accessible through GraphQL. It provides similar functionality to The Graph but for StarkNet. Checkpoint performs two main functionalities:

1. Indexing contract data based on StarkNet events
2. Exposes a GraphQL API to query this data.
